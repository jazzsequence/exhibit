### CODE NAME: Exhibit
Version: 0.2.1

This is an experimental theme built as a way to explore the [WP-API](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API). It is based on Rachel Baker's [WCUS talk](http://wordpress.tv/2015/12/09/rachel-baker-build-a-theme-with-the-rest-api/) (and [project on GitHub](https://github.com/rachelbaker/wcus-demo)) and, ultimately is planned to be a WP-API port of my theme [Museum Core](https://github.com/jazzsequence/museum-core/).
